<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is a simple chat web app that includes group and one-to-one chat; I relate the terminologies with that of blockchain i call group chat as blocks, because a block in blockchain contains series of transaction so also we've series of chat in block in this web app -- EDFolmi.

Here's why:
* To have a practical understanding of websockets.
* Curious to know how chat apps works
* I love coding! :smile:

I will add more features and AI technology to this project!
